# üß† Diabetic Eye Retinopathy Detection

This repository contains multiple deep learning experiments for **Diabetic Eye Retinopathy (DR) classification** using state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. The goal is to develop automated systems to detect DR from retinal images with high accuracy, exploring various models, optimizers, and training strategies.

## üìå Overview

Diabetic Retinopathy is a diabetes-related complication that affects the eyes and can lead to blindness if untreated. Early detection is critical, and automated DR classification can assist ophthalmologists by providing fast and reliable screening.

This project implements and compares several CNN models on a **dataset of 1,500 retinal images** divided into **2 classes** (DR and No DR). Model accuracies range from **70% to 85%**, depending on architecture and training strategies.
